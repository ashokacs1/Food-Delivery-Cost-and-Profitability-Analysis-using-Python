# Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis

## Overview
Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis involves evaluating all costs associated with delivering food orders, including direct expenses (delivery fees, packaging) and indirect expenses (discounts, restaurant commission fees). By comparing these costs against generated revenue (order values, commission fees), this analysis provides insights into per-order profitability and overall financial performance.

## Objectives
- Identify all cost components in food delivery operations.
- Assess revenue sources and their contribution to profitability.
- Determine per-order profitability and trends.
- Develop strategic recommendations to enhance profitability.
- Simulate the financial impact of proposed changes.

## Process Workflow
### 1. Data Collection
Gather comprehensive data covering:
- Order details (order value, discounts, final charge, etc.)
- Delivery fees and packaging costs
- Commission fees paid to restaurants
- Other operational expenses

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Remove irrelevant information.
- Ensure data accuracy and consistency.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Identify key metrics influencing profitability.
- Create new calculated columns for further analysis.

### 4. Cost Breakdown
- **Fixed Costs:** Packaging, platform maintenance.
- **Variable Costs:** Delivery fees, discounts, commissions.

### 5. Revenue Analysis
- Revenue from customers (order value before discounts).
- Commission fees from restaurants.

### 6. Profitability Calculation
- Calculate profit per order:
  \[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Costs} \]
- Analyze profitability distribution and trends.

### 7. Strategic Recommendations
- Identify areas of cost optimization.
- Suggest strategies for adjusting fees, discounts, and commissions.
- Optimize delivery operations for cost reduction.

### 8. Financial Impact Simulation
- Model financial impact of proposed adjustments.
- Evaluate potential profitability improvements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Expected Outcomes
- A clear breakdown of food delivery costs.
- Insights into per-order profitability.
- Recommendations to enhance business profitability.
